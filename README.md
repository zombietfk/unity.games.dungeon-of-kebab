# EOB-like-dungeon-crawl
A Unity project, mimicking the old eye of the beholder games!

My first ever unity project, originally made in unity 5.1 in 2017

Having lived though the Unity year based versioning system completely untouched, now updated for Unity 6.0 compatability! The first updates seen in 8 long years.

Half proud, half ashamed of this project, it has all the original bugs and warts with the updated version*. A remake is certainly on the cards although will almost certainly be done in Godot, as my preferred game engine these days. Feel free to check out the build for linux, windows or on my itch.io account, and perhaps anyone starting their Unity journey can take some of the code to see how I did things (Although I had no idea what I was doing at the time! So take what you will, with a grain of salt ;))

*Difficulty was lowered as the original was too damn hard for me now, and some unused UI elements were removed, but everything else has remained the same! See 1.1.0 Release notes for details
